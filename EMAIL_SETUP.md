# Email Setup Guide for Portfolio Contact Form

## Overview
Your portfolio contact form uses **Cloudflare Functions** to handle email sending, with support for multiple email services. The form will send emails from `noreply@addtocloud.tech` to `gokul@addtocloud.tech` when someone fills out the contact form.

## Architecture
- **Frontend**: Next.js contact form (static export)
- **Backend**: Cloudflare Function (`/functions/api/contact.js`)
- **Email Services**: Resend, SMTP2GO, or EmailJS (configurable)

## Recommended Setup: Resend (Primary)

Resend is the recommended email service because it works seamlessly with Cloudflare Functions:

### Step 1: Create Resend Account
1. Go to [resend.com](https://resend.com)
2. Sign up with your email
3. Verify your account

### Step 2: Add Your Domain
1. In Resend dashboard, go to "Domains"
2. Add `addtocloud.tech` as your domain
3. Add the required DNS records to your domain registrar:
   - SPF record
   - DKIM records
   - DMARC record (optional but recommended)

### Step 3: Get API Key
1. Go to "API Keys" in Resend dashboard
2. Create a new API key
3. Copy the key (starts with `re_`)

### Step 4: Add to Environment Variables
For Cloudflare Pages deployment:
```bash
wrangler pages secret put RESEND_API_KEY --project-name portfolio
```

When prompted, enter your Resend API key.

## Alternative Setup: SMTP2GO (Fallback)
- Simple setup and great developer experience
- Reliable delivery
- Free tier: 3,000 emails/month
- Works seamlessly with Next.js

### Step 1: Create Resend Account
1. Go to [resend.com](https://resend.com)
2. Sign up with your email
3. Verify your account

### Step 2: Add Your Domain
1. In Resend dashboard, go to "Domains"
2. Add `addtocloud.tech` as your domain
3. Add the required DNS records to your domain registrar:
   - SPF record
   - DKIM records
   - DMARC record (optional but recommended)

### Step 3: Get API Key
1. Go to "API Keys" in Resend dashboard
2. Create a new API key
3. Copy the key (starts with `re_`)

### Step 4: Add to Environment Variables
1. Update `.env.local`:
   ```
   RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_actual_api_key_here
   ```

2. For Cloudflare Pages deployment, add environment variable:
   - Go to Cloudflare Pages dashboard
   - Select your portfolio project
   - Go to Settings â†’ Environment Variables
   - Add `RESEND_API_KEY` with your API key

## Alternative Options

### Option 2: EmailJS (No server required)
Good for static sites, works entirely in the browser.

1. Sign up at [emailjs.com](https://www.emailjs.com/)
2. Create a service (Gmail, Outlook, etc.)
3. Create an email template
4. Get your Service ID, Template ID, and keys
5. Add to environment variables:
   ```
   EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID=your_service_id
   EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID=your_template_id
   EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY=your_public_key
   EMAILJS_PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key
   ```

### Option 3: SMTP2GO
Alternative SMTP service for reliable delivery.

1. Sign up at [smtp2go.com](https://www.smtp2go.com/)
2. Get your API key
3. Add to environment variables:
   ```
   SMTP2GO_API_KEY=your_api_key
   ```

## Testing

### Local Testing
1. Add your API key to `.env.local`
2. Run `npm run dev`
3. Go to the contact section
4. Fill out and submit the form
5. Check the console for success/error messages

### Production Testing
1. Deploy with environment variables set
2. Test the contact form on your live site

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Domain not verified**: Make sure you've added and verified your domain in Resend
